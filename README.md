Mini Projects

This repository is a compilation of mini projects aimed at exploring various Python concepts and libraries. Some are implemented using Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook to provide an interactive environment for experimentation and learning.

List of projects included in this repository:

Youtube Data Visualization: My first attempt at using pandas and plotly libraries in Google Colab to visualize basic analytics of the top 1000 channels (subscriber counts, categories, years started) .

Blog Generator: AI blog/paragraph generator that uses OpenAI API and GPT 3.5 to answer prompts.

QR Code Generator: Uses qrcode library that saves a QR code .png of any website link.

Stock Analyzer: Takes a 20 day range of prices of a stock ($AMC), and allows the user to find the price on a given day in the range, the minimum price in the range, or the maximum price in the range.
